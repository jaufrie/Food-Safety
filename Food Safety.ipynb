The scores and violation information have been made available by the San Francisco Department of Public Health. The main goal for this assignment is to understand how restaurants are scored. We will walk through various steps of exploratory data analysis to do this. We will provide comments and insights along the way to give you a sense of how we arrive at each discovery and what next steps it leads to.\n",

In addition, there appears to be some gaps towards the higher 90's scores at about 98/99. and in between 90 and 100 (~95). Besides the skewness and gaps there doesn't appear to be other unusual features of the distribution. In addition, the distribution implies that restaurants were most likely ready for the inspection considering the high amount of high scores that are shown and the low amount of low scores. "

If a `business_id` in `ins` does not exist in `bus`, the name and address should be given as NaN.\n",

Beef tripe tastes like wonton wrap, so mushy and a strong sticky smell, feel like it was reheated from someone's leftovers\".

    "Another way to compare the scores from the two inspections is to examine the difference in scores. Subtract the first score from the second in `scores_pairs_by_business`. Make a histogram of these differences in the scores. We might expect these differences to be positive, indicating an improvement from the first to the second inspection.\n",

    "If a restaurant's score improves from the first to the second inspection from the first to the second inspection then the y value (second score) of a point will be much bigger / higher than the x value (first score). This would then result in points being in the top left corner of the plot. However, we don't tend to see this in our plot as most points tend to be linear following the y=x line. Although, there are the occasional ones that do have a much higher y value as compared to their x value and therefore leads to them being far away from the line. The histogram is approximately normal which supports the idea that most restaurants got a similar score as their first one and thus making their difference close to 0. However, if the second score would have been higher than the first then the histogram should have been skewed left which it isn't. "
